Q> can we can select multiple slave at same time in SPI?
Ans: no, we can't because we are having only 1 shift register, so it can serve data to 1 slave at a time.
Q> speed of I2c and SPI
Ans: I2C:
     The data rate has to be chosen between 100 kbps, 400 kbps and 3.4 Mbps, respectively called standard mode, 
     fast mode and high speed mode.
     Some IÂ²C variants include 10 kbps (low speed mode) and 1 Mbps (fast mode +) as valid speeds.
     
     SPI:upto 1 Mb or 10 mb
     
     Both single-master and multi-master protocols are possible in SPI.
     But the multi-master bus is rarely used and look awkward, and are usually limited to a single slave.
