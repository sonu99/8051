SSD:
+++++++

A typical SSD uses what is called NAND-based flash memory. This is a non-volatile type of memory.
What does non-volatile mean you ask? The simple answer is that you can turn off the disk and it won’t “forget” what was stored on it. 
This is of course an essential characteristic of any type of permanent memory. 
During the early days of SSD, rumors floated around saying stored data would wear off and be lost after only a few years.
Regardless, that rumor is certainly not true with today’s technology, 
as you can read and write to an SSD all day long and the data storage integrity will be maintained for well over 200 years.
In other words, the data storage life of an SSD can outlive you!

The connector used for these standard sizes is SATA. 
There are smaller SSDs available that use what’s called mini-SATA (mSATA) and fit into the mini-PCI Express slot of a laptop

A solid-state drive isn’t just the same components you’d find crammed into a flash drive or SD card. 
They have the same type of NAND flash memory chips, sure — but there’s more NAND chips and they tend to be faster, better-quality chips. 
However, the solid-state drive also contains a controller with a firmware that contains more advanced features. 

HDD:
++++
An HDD uses magnetism to store data on a rotating platter.
A read/write head floats above the spinning platter reading and writing data. 
The faster the platter spins, the faster an HDD can perform. 
Typical laptop drives today spin at either 5400 RPM (Revolutions per Minute) or 7200RPM, though some server-based platters spin at
up to 15,000 RPM!

The major advantage of an HDD is that it is capable of storing lots of data cheaply

eMMC:
+++++
A MultiMediaCard — also known as MMC — is similar to an SD card. The SD card standard was considered an improvement over MMC,
so few devices have built-in MMC slots today — you’ll mostly find SD card slots instead. eMMC isn’t just an older type of storage,
however. While MMC fell by the wayside, the eMMC specification continued to be developed and worked on.

eMMC stands for embedded MultiMediaCard. In other words,
an eMMC drive isn’t a sophisticated internal drive with speeds and features on par with the SSDs you’d find in typical desktops and 
laptop computers. Instead, it’s basically a MMC — like an SD card — embedded onto the device’s motherboard. Like SD cards, MMC cards and
their interfaces are much slower than an SSD. It’s a way to provide cheap internal storage.
The eMMC device also has a controller that makes the eMMC bootable so it can be used as a system drive inside cheap Android, Windows,
and Chrome OS tablets and laptops. However, it doesn’t have the firmware, multiple flash memory chips, high-quality hardware, 
and fast interface that makes a solid-state drive so fast.
Just as SD cards are much slower than internal SSDs, eMMC storage is much slower than a more sophisticated SSD.

Flash
+++++
Flash memory is an electronic (solid-state) non-volatile computer storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed.

Toshiba developed flash memory from EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) in the early 
1980s and introduced it to the market in 1984. The two main types of flash memory are named after the NAND and NOR logic gates. 
The individual flash memory cells exhibit internal characteristics similar to those of the corresponding gates.

USB stik and SD card
++++++++++++++++++++
Flash memory — typically NAND flash memory — is found in USB flash drives and all the different types of SD cards you’d buy.
USB flash drives contain a flash memory chip on a printed circuit board (PCB) as well as a basic controller and a USB interface. 
SD cards contain a flash memory chip on a circuit board along with an SD controller.
Both SD cards and flash drives aren’t very sophisticated.
They don’t have the sophisticated firmware or other advanced features you’d find in an SSD.
They’re generally designed to be as cheap as possible.
